# Anomaly-Detection-In-Financial-Transaction
🚀 Excited to share my latest project where I utilized the Ethereum dataset for anomaly detection in financial transactions! 📈 I used the powerful isolation forest algorithm to identify anomalies in the data. Here's a brief overview of the steps I took :

1️⃣ Checked for duplicates and missing values in the data.
2️⃣ Removed unwanted columns to streamline the dataset.
3️⃣ Eliminated columns with constant variance to improve model performance.
4️⃣ Converted object data type columns into numeric using target encoders, as the isolation forest algorithm only works with numeric data.
5️⃣ Applied the isolation forest algorithm to detect anomalies in the financial transactions.

One of the intriguing findings was that the missing values exhibited a pattern, with 90% of rows with missing values being flagged as anomalies in the dataset. This insight could potentially lead to further investigation into the nature of these missing values and their impact on the dataset.

Excited to continue exploring the possibilities of anomaly detection in financial transactions and leveraging the power of machine learning to uncover valuable insights! 💡 #MachineLearning #AnomalyDetection #Ethereum #DataScience
